|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Scheduled         | scheduled        | Flight is scheduled |
| Active            | active           | Flight is airborne |
| Completed         | landed           | Flight has landed |
| Cancelled         | cancelled        | Flight cancelled |
| Diverted          | diverted         | Flight diverted |

## API Endpoints Used

### Flight Search
- **Endpoint**: `/flights/{flight_number}`
- **Example**: `/flights/UA400`
- **Returns**: Multiple flights for that identifier

### Aircraft Search  
- **Primary**: `/flights/{tail_number}`
- **Fallback**: `/aircraft/{tail_number}/flights`
- **Example**: `/flights/N300DG`

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
```
‚ùå API authentication failed
```

### Rate Limiting
```
‚ùå API rate limit exceeded
```

### Invalid Flight Format
```
‚ùå Invalid format. Please use a flight number (e.g., "UA400") or tail number (e.g., "N300DG").
```

### Flight Not Found
```
‚ùå Flight "ZZ9999" not found. Please check the flight number or tail number and try again.
```

## Usage Tracking

The bot tracks API usage to prevent exceeding your FlightAware plan limits:

- **Warning at 80%**: Shows usage warnings
- **Critical at 95%**: Limits tracking to 2 most recent flights
- **Exhausted at 100%**: Stops all API requests

## Message Formatting

### Enhanced Display
- **Aircraft Information**: Shows registration and type for tail number searches
- **Gate/Terminal Data**: Displays when available
- **Progress Updates**: Shows flight progress percentage
- **FlightAware Links**: Direct links to detailed tracking
