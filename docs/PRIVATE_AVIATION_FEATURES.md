# Private Aviation Features

FlightBot has been specifically tailored for private aviation and pilot-focused Slack groups with enhanced formatting and relevant information display.

## Key Features for Private Aviation

### 1. **Smart Aircraft Identification**
- **Private aircraft**: Shows tail number (e.g., "N123AB") instead of "Flight N123AB"
- **Commercial flights**: Still shows "Flight UA400" format
- **Automatic detection**: Based on airline information presence

### 2. **Pilot-Friendly Airport Information**
- **ICAO codes first**: Shows KJFK instead of just JFK (pilot preference)
- **Dual codes**: Displays "KJFK / JFK" when both available
- **Full airport names**: "John F Kennedy Intl (KJFK / JFK)"

### 3. **Enhanced Time Information**
- **Time type indicators**: (Actual), (Est), or (Sched)
- **Priority display**: Actual > Estimated > Scheduled
- **Pilot-relevant**: Shows the most current time information

### 4. **Aircraft Details**
- **Registration and type**: "N123AB (C172)" 
- **Progress tracking**: Flight progress percentage when available
- **Route information**: Filed flight route when available

## Technical Implementation

The bot automatically detects flight type based on:
- **Airline presence**: Commercial flights have airline data
- **Search method**: Tail number vs. flight number search
- **Aircraft registration**: Matches the searched identifier

This ensures the most relevant information is displayed for each flight type, making the bot valuable for both private aviation operations and commercial flight tracking.
